# Daily Word Definition

## General info
* This is a desktop app that displays a word and its definition once a day.
* It's goal is to enhance your vocabulary.
* Users define the words and their definitions.
* To start, stop, or modify the app, click the 'Daily Word Definition' icon in the main folder or on the desktop (if a shortcut was created during installation).

## Installer
* An installer for the program can be found at: https://github.com/timbob04/DailyWordDefinition/releases/tag/v1.0

## Starting the program
* Click the 'Daily Word Definition' icon to start the app.
* A window will open allowing you to set the time for the daily word to appear (in 24-hour format).
* You can choose to add the app to your computer's startup folder so it runs automatically after a restart.  The startup folder is detected automatically but you can change it if needed.
* Once finished, click 'Start' to run the program.  It will now operate in the background, displaying the daily word at the selected time.

## The program
* At the chosen time (above), a window will open to display the daily word and its definition.
* If the computer is off at the chosen display time, the word will appear as soon as the computer is turned on after this.
* Only the word is shown first, to let you guess its definition.  Click 'Reveal' to see the definition.
* Closing the window doesnâ€™t stop the program.  
* If the window is left open, it will automatically close when the next day's word appears.

## Stopping the program (or changing its running time)
* Click the 'Daily Word Definition' icon.
* A window will open where you can either stop the program (using the toggle) or change the time in which the daily word appears.
* Stopping the program removes it from the startup folder (if previously added).

## Adding or editing words and their definitions
* Click the 'Daily Word Definition' icon.
* Then, click on 'Edit Word List'.
* In the 'Edit Word List' window, you can add new words and definitions (top section) or edit/delete existing entries (bottom section).

## Priority words
* Mark words as 'priority words' either when they appear as the daily word (using the toggle) or in the 'Edit Word List' window.
* Priority words are displayed below the daily word.
* The idea is to designate a few select words as priority words, making them appear frequently and thus help with their memorization.
