In the startStop folder, start making the main script that will be the exe file that runs when the icon is pressed.

This will first check if a program is already running (using the PID)

If yes, the API to stop the program will come up.

If the user wants to stop the program, use the PID to stop the program.

If the program is not already running, then run the startProgram API.

If the user says yes, then running the program (the main running program script, which will be the other main script) - 'user input' (icon), and 'running'.



The next thing to do AFTER all of this, is to get the startup folder stuff working - adding or removing the script to the startup folder when the user starts (and hits the toggle to add to startup folder) or stops the program.
