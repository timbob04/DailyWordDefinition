*** Daily word definition ***

# General info #
> This is a desktop app that presents a word and its definition daily.
> Its purpose is to improve one's vocabulary.
> The words and definitions are user-defined.
> To start, stop, or modify the program, click the 'Daily Word Definition' icon in the main folder, or on the desktop (if selected during installation).

# Starting the program #
> To start the program, click on the 'Daily Word Definition' icon.
> A window opens that allows you to select the time in which the daily word and its definition appears - this time is in 24 hour clock format.
> You can also choose to add the main program to your computer's startup folder, ensuring it continues running after the computer turns off and back on.
> The startup folder is found automatically, but you can change it if needed.
> Press the 'Start' button once a time is entered.  The main program is now running and a daily word and its definition will appear at the selected time.

# The program #
> Every day, a window opens showing the daily word and its definition.
> This happens at the pre-selected time (section above), or as soon as the computer is turned on if this happens after that time.
> The program is designed to show the word only first, so you can guess its definition before revealing it.
> To reveal the word's definition, press the 'Reveal' button.
> Closing the window doesn't stop the program running.  If you don't close the window, it will close automatically when the next day's word appears.

# Stopping the program #
> To stop the program, click again on the 'Daily Word Definition' icon.
> A window will open that allows you to either 1) stop the program (toggle), or 2) change the time in which the daily word appears.
> Stopping the program removes it from the startup folder (if this option is selected when starting the program).

# Adding or editing words and their definitions #
> To add or edit your chosen words and definitions, click on the 'Daily Word Definition' icon.
> Whether the program is running or not, the windows to both start and stop the program have a 'Edit word list' button.
> Clicking this brings up a new window that allows you to add words and their definitions (top section), or edit/delete previous entries (bottom section).

# Priority words # 
> You can mark a word as a 'priority word', either when it appears as the daily word (using the toggle), or in the 'Edit Word List' window.
> Priority words appear below the daily word in the window showing the daily word and its definition.
> The idea is to designate a few select words as priority words, making them appear frequently and thus help with memorization.
